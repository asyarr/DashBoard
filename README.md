## Netflix Dashboard Project

This project was developed using the Netflix database sourced from Kaggle. The primary objective was to analyze and visualize various aspects of Netflix's content library and its performance.

 ### Data Transformation and Web Scraping

- R: I utilized R for transforming the raw data tables into a more structured format suitable for analysis.
- rvest: This package was employed to scrape data about Oscar Awards from the web. The goal was to enrich the Netflix dataset with additional information on award-winning titles available on the platform.
- quantmod: To incorporate financial analysis, I used the quantmod package to retrieve and analyze stock information for Netflix. This helped in understanding the market trends and financial performance of the company.

### Dashboard Overview

- Netflix Films Database

The dashboard includes a visualization of the total viewing time required to watch the entire Netflix movie catalog. That is equivalent to 423.8 days of continuous viewing. Additionally, the dashboard highlights the top 10 cast members based on their appearance frequency in the catalog. Also shows how many titles Netflix created in the past years.
