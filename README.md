## Netflix Dashboard Project

This project was developed using the Netflix database sourced from Kaggle. The primary objective was to analyze and visualize various aspects of Netflix's content library and its performance.

### Data Transformation and Web Scraping

- R: I utilized R for transforming the raw data tables into a more structured format suitable for analysis.
- rvest: This package was employed to scrape data about Oscar Awards from the web. The goal was to enrich the Netflix dataset with additional information on award-winning titles available on the platform.
- quantmod: To incorporate financial analysis, I used the quantmod package to retrieve and analyze stock information for Netflix. This helped in understanding the market trends and financial performance of the company.
